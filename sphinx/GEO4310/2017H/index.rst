Data Science Tools
##################


Overview
---------

Getting started with data scientific analysis, programs, statistics, and general data science tools can be a bit daunting. This course has the ambition to guide you through this process with the objective of providing a fundamental knowledge of statistical processes related to hydrologic and meteorologic analysis.

While the main objective of this course is that you walk away with an appreciation for stochastic processes, you should also gain powerful tools to conduct in depth analysis of complex data sets.

Herein, I hope to provide some resources related to learning fundamental data science skills.

Installing Python
=================

The easiest way to get started with data science is to learn `Python <https://python.org>`_. Python is a powerful and simple object oriented language that greatly facilitates data processing. While there are other languages to choose from (e.g. Julia, R, etc.), a great benefit to python is that once you have learned it, you will have at your fingertips the resources to build things!

To get started, I recommend to download the `Anaconda Python <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_. It comes packaged with most of the things you will need ever.

Learn the basics
==================

We will go over the basic aspects of the language during our first exercise session. However, you should plan to spend a great deal more time to learn the language. You will not become an expert immediately, but it won't take too long either before you start to appreciate what you can accomplish with a few lines of code. Most importantly is to understand the basics of the language, libraries, and data structure. For this, follow the free `interactive Python tutorial by DataCamp <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`_. This 4 hour coding course focuses on how to get started with Python for data science and by the end you should be comfortable with the basic concepts of the language.

Specifically learn: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, List comprehensions, Dictionary comprehensions 

understand modules
==================

Python alone is not tremendously useful and quite inefficient. You will have to use various modules that are freely available and provide much more rapid computations. This is the fun part now! Take some time to complete the following tutorials:

- `Numpy Quickstart <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html>`_
- `Scipy Tutorials <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html>`_ are great. Specifically, check out the 'stats' module.
- `Ten Minutes to Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html>`_ is an important resource. You will be using Pandas quite extensively in the exercises of this course.

You can also see DataCampâ€™s Pandas Foundations course or Google "Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney" you'll probably find a `pdf to download <http://www3.canisius.edu/~yany/python/Python4DataAnalysis.pdf>`_.
